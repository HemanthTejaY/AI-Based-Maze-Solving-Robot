# AI-Based-Maze-Solving-Robot
The field of robotics has advanced greatly in recent years, having a large field of research in finding solutions to everyday
problems, such as problems solving mazes and test new designs. The objective of the project is in using an autonomous robot 
with ultrasonic sensors in solving mazes, using automation, robotics, artificial intelligence and computational logic. Verifying and analysing the logic used in the process of solving mazes,where there is only a beginning and an end,autonomously.
